## First things First!

Hello! I am a professional mathematician and I like to share what I am discovering. So I hope this blog helps to understand and divulge my discoveries. Not everything I've published here is exactly my own work. Many things are disclosures from other researchers and papers that I am interested in.

The English language is not my native language so I may have committed several gaffes while writing here. Feel free to email me if you see something strangely written! Please!

In addition, I hope you like the texts released!
